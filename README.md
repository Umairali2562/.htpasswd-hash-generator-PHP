# .htpasswd-hash-generator-PHP

About the .htaccess file:

# The .htaccess will have the codes that would let the server know to use authentication against all clients (browser or anything else).
# In this file, .htaccess you'll see two links , one is going to be the directory link that you wanna set password on ,and the second would be the auth file where the user and passwdis present
# the password will be in hash format else , the code won't work .

About the hash.php file:

# The function which is written in this file can generate a nice apr1 hash , that will work perfectly without any error.
# Unlike the other codes from the internet , Believe I tested them all but doesn't work , but this one does , took it from the stackoverflow so I guess I can't have any credits for it -)
